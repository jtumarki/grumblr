grumblr
=======

Project using Django/Bootstrap that I did for a web apps class. Essentially a twitter-esque site.

In the main hw2part2 folder, run from the command line: python manage.py runserver and go to localhost:8000 in your browser. You can register an account, login, post grumbls, see all other users' grumbls, search for grumbls by keyword, view and edit your profile. More functionality will be added with later revisions
